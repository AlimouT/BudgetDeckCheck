# Deck Checker

This is a deck checking script for the Budget-Restricted EDH format we'll be playing. It uses Scryfall's API to find the cheapest legal card and calculates the total deck price. It also provides a deckl info file which can be used to import decks into popular sites such as Scryfall itself or mtggoldfish.

### TO-DO
- Add the argument-based deck look up rather than hardcoded file paths.
